# HeadPoseEstimation
This repository conations Machine learning project using MediaPipeFace Mesh which is a solution that estimates 468 3D face landmarks in real-time and Sklearn to prdict values of a human head.

# What is Head Pose Estimation?
<p>Head Pose Estimation research in Computer Vision focuses on the prediction of the pose of a human head in an image. More specifically, it concerns the prediction of the Euler angles of a human head. The Euler angles consists of three values: yaw, pitch and roll.</p>
